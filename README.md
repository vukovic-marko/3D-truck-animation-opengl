# 3D Garbage Truck Animation with OpenGL API in C# and WPF

Welcome to the project page for the 3D Garbage Truck Animation built using the OpenGL API in C# and WPF! 🚚🗑️

## Project Overview

The 3D Garbage Truck Animation project is a university project that demonstrates a simplified yet engaging scene of a garbage truck in action. Using the OpenGL API in C# and WPF, I have created an animated sequence where the garbage truck approaches a dumpster, lifts and tilts it, and continues its route. This project explores different lighting techniques, basic textures, and user interactions to enhance the overall experience. 💡🌌

## Key Features

- Garbage Truck Animation: The project features a basic 3D garbage truck model with animations for approaching the dumpster, lifting it, tilting it, and resuming its journey.
- Dumpster Interaction: Users can initiate the animation sequence and observe the garbage truck's interaction with the dumpster.
- Basic Lighting and Shadows: The animation incorporates simple lighting techniques to provide shading and shadow effects, adding a sense of depth to the scene.
- User Interactions: Users can interact with the animation by adjusting the height of the lamppost, controlling the animation speed, scaling the lamppost, and rotating the camera to explore different angles. 🎥🌇

## Technologies Used

- C#: The project is developed using the C# programming language, which provides a powerful and versatile environment for building applications.
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): WPF is utilized as the user interface framework, enabling the seamless integration of 3D graphics into the application.
- OpenGL API: The OpenGL API is employed to access the underlying graphics hardware and implement basic rendering techniques for the 3D animation. 💻🎨

## Getting Started

To explore the 3D Garbage Truck Animation project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-truck-animation-opengl.git`
2. Install the required dependencies, ensuring that the OpenGL libraries are properly configured.
3. Build and run the application.
4. Use the provided controls to adjust the lamppost height, animation speed, lamppost scale, and camera rotation.
5. Experience the basic garbage truck animation and interact with the scene. 🚀🎮
